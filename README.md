# MovieSearchWebsite
  update:
    refactor is coming soon. I plan to make it a dedicated website to watch any movie ever know.

### This website is build using a replace content on the html.
#### 1. Firstly, a single card is built on the html
#### 2. The page is given a style that matches a card in the css
#### #. A search bar is also provided via form tag and input tag on the html. Our search requests are made through this form made possible with an event listener put on the form watching "submit".
#### 3. A fetch request is made to an api link that we made to return movie images and their titles.
#### # A loop is made through each return item returning their image and title and appending them to the card on the html. 
#### 4. The return we used and did an update with dom manipulation of the card image with the movie image and the card info with the movie title.
